Description: The count-min-sketch is a probabilistic algorithm for computing
    the approximate frequency of strings in a space-efficient and computationally-
    efficient manner. (See Cormode and Muthukrishnan, "An improved data stream
    summary: the count-min sketch and its applications.") Note: hashing is provided
    by the public domain MurmurHash3 implementation (https://github.com/aappleby/
    smhasher).
